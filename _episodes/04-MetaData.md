title: Working with experimental metadata
teaching: 10
exercises: 5
source: Rmd
objectives:
- Be able to use metadata from GEO objects to construct useful R data objects
- Be able to use read.celfiles in combination with your own pData object to ensure data integrity
questions:
- "If an experiment were more complicated, and included several independent variables, would you be able to create a phenoData object from the GSE?"
keypoints: 
- GEO metadata can be cast into R data objects for analysis. The details are up to the user.
- Using proper phenoData to describe an experiment helps to ensure reproducibility and avoid reading in files out of order
---



We have successfully read CEL files into an R object, but we
haven't provided any information about the experimental design, which would
normally be provided in a phenoData object.  In the case of our two
experiments, the experimental designs are pretty simple. Let's see if
we can find the information we need from the metadata.

## What you should have

If you have been following this tutorial, you should have the following objects:

- An _ExpressionSet_ object for GSE33146 (the processed data). Let's assume this is called `gse33146`.
- An _ExpressionSet_ object for GSE66417  (the processed data). Let's assume this is called `gse66417`.
- An _ExpressionFeatureSet_ object for GSE33146 (the raw data). Let's assume this is called `gse33146_celdata`. 
- A _GeneFeatureSet_ object for GSE66417 (the raw data). Let's assume this is called `gse66417_celdata`. 
 
> ## Why do the raw data for the two experiments appear to be different classes? 
>
> The GSE33146 raw data is of class ExpressionFeatureSet, but the
> GSE66417 data is of class GeneFeatureSet. Raw Affymetrix data is all
> some form of "FeatureSet" data, but different array designs are
> _extensions_ of the abstract FeatureSet class. The first series is
> from a 3â€²-biased array design, and the second is from a gene-based
> design. The classes represent those different design types.

## GSE33146

In the simple case, we already have an ExpressionSet object, and we can use the pData from it.

With this simple trick, we now can re-read out CEL files, and _guarantee_ that they are in the correct order as the experimental data we have from getGEO.

## GSE66417

We can do the same thing with our second data set, but we can see that the experimental  layout is more complicated

We can repeat our simple trick to guarantee our cel files and our metadata are aligned.
