title: Working with experimental metadata
teaching: 10
exercises: 5
source: Rmd
objectives:
- Be able to use metadata from GEO objects to construct useful R data objects
- Be able to use read.celfiles in combination with your own pData object to ensure data integrity
questions:
- "If an experiment were more complicated, and included several independent variables, would you be able to create a phenoData object from the GSE?"
keypoints: 
- GEO metadata can be cast into R data objects for analysis. The details are up to the user.
- Using proper phenoData to describe an experiment helps to ensure reproducibility and avoid reading in files out of order
---



We have successfully read CEL files into an R object, but we
haven't provided any information about the experimental design, which would
normally be provided in a phenoData object.  In the case of our two
experiments, the experimental designs are pretty simple. Let's see if
we can find the information we need from the metadata.

## What you should have

If you have been following this tutorial, you should have the following objects:

- An _ExpressionSet_ object for GSE33146 (the processed data). Let's assume this is called `gse33146`.
- An _ExpressionSet_ object for GSE66417  (the processed data). Let's assume this is called `gse66417`.
- An _ExpressionFeatureSet_ object for GSE33146 (the raw data). Let's assume this is called `gse33146_celdata`. 
- A _GeneFeatureSet_ object for GSE66417 (the raw data). Let's assume this is called `gse66417_celdata`. 
 
> ## Why do the raw data for the two experiments appear to be different classes? 
>
> The GSE33146 raw data is of class ExpressionFeatureSet, but the
> GSE66417 data is of class GeneFeatureSet. Raw Affymetrix data is all
> some form of "FeatureSet" data, but different array designs are
> _extensions_ of the abstract FeatureSet class. The first series is
> from a 3â€²-biased array design, and the second is from a gene-based
> design. The classes represent those different design types.

## GSE33146

In the simple case, we already have an ExpressionSet object, and we can use the pData from it.

With this simple trick, we now can re-read out CEL files, and _guarantee_ that they are in the correct order as the experimental data we have from getGEO.
