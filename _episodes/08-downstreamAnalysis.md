title: "Basic downstream analysis of microarray data"
source: Rmd
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions: 
- "What can we do to interpret the data from our differential expression analysis?"
objectives:
- "Be able to plot volcano plots and heatmaps in R." 
- "Be able to interpret the above plots generated."
- "Be aware of some downstream analysis that are commonly done to interpret the results of differential expression analysis." 

keypoints: 
- "Volcano plots can be used to infer relationships between fold changes and statstical confidence."
- "Heatmaps can be used to visualize distinct trends in gene expression patterns between different experimental conditions by clustering."
