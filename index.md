Microarrays are widely used to interrogate the gene expression of
cells in a transcriptome-wide manner. Although RNA-seq has emerged as
the method of choice with the decreasing cost of sequencing,
microarrays still remain a popular method due to the lower cost and
the simplicity of analysis, and many existing data sets using microarrays are still valuable for anlaysis. 
This lesson will introduce you to using analysing gene expression experiments on microarrays using linear models of differential expression. 



> ## Prerequisites
>
> The first day of the lesson assumes a basic knowledge of R, and theoretical knowledge of how gene expression microarray experiments are peformed. 
> The second day assumes theoretical familiarity with how diffferentially expressed genes are identified using microarrays.
